# An Analysis of PyBer's Ride Data

## Overview of Project
    This project is used to determine the total and average values for both fare data and driver data for PyBer based on each city type.
### Purpose
    The purpose is to determine total fares, drivers and rides for PyBer, as well as the average fares per ride and driver, all of which are broken down into three different city types, rural, urban and suburban. The total weekly fare for all three city types will also be graphed and compared to see any differences and trends among the data.

## Results
    Different ride sharing data among different city types will be compared here. More detailed data may be found in the Jupyter Notebook file.
### Total and average fares for different city types:
    As might be predictated, there are many more total rides and drivers in urban city types than rural city types, with suburban being in the middle of those two city types. While the urban city types do have a higher total fares than suburban and rural city types, that is a result of it having much more total drivers and rides, the average fare per ride and per driver is highest in the rural city type and lowest in the urban city type, with suburban being the middle again. Creating a inverse relationship with the total rides and drivers per city type.

### Total weekly fares across different city types:
    The total weekly fare is by far the highest in the urban city type, the lowest in the rural city type and suburban in the middle of the two types. Although there are changes in the value across the weeks for all three city types, the order of urban, suburban and rural being highest to lowest holds true for all weeks.

## Summary
    The analysis showed clear differences between the three different city types. Some changes could be made to address the differences between the different city types.
### 1.Focus on recuriting more rural drivers:
    Currently the amount of drivers and rides in rural city types are much lower than the other two types, with more drivers in those cities, the number of rides should also go up.
### 2.Reduce number of drivers in urban cities:
    Related to the problem with rural cities, the number of drivers also means the number of rides in the city is much higher than average, if any drivers there could be convinced to move rides to more rural and suburban city types it would drag up the total drivers for those two city types as well.
### 3.Increase fare rates in urban cities:
    Currently the fare per driver and ride is lowest in urban cities, with most of the drivers and rides in urban city types, increasing this rate will increase the overall fares the most out of the three city types.
